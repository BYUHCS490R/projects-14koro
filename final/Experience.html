        I seem to have a tendency to gain weight easily. I ate a lot and didn't exercise much. But I fell in love and decided to change myself.

            Changing yourself is incredibly difficult. For me, changing myself means changing my life. In other words, it means changing my own habits, hobbies, and values. 
            Changing them isn't easy, and accepting them is hard. But if you can embrace change, tomorrow's you will be cooler than today's.
