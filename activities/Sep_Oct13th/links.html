        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p><strong>2. What is the root? 
            What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</strong></p>
        <p>The root is the top-level folder of your website. 
            A path shows the directions from the root folder to the file. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. What is a default document?</strong></p>
        <p>A default document is a file that is automatically loaded when you access a directory. </p>
        <p><strong>4. Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. 
            Why would you use relative links?</strong></p>
        <p>Absolute links are used when referencing other websites. In such cases, use the full address.
Relative links are used when referencing within files you have created. Using relative links is easier.</p>
        <p><strong>6. List the 3 rules with relative links.</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inside a folder</li>
            <li>Up and then down a folder</li>
            <li>Start over</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>8. Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</strong></p>
        <p>No. Nav is used for a set of main navigation links, but links can appear anywhere.</p>
