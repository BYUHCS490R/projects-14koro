        <h2>Welcome to My Mission Area!</h2>
        <p>Hokkaido is Japan's northernmost city. Unlike Fukuoka, its cold climate brings significant snowfall. 
            Before becoming part of Japan in 1869, Hokkaido was the homeland of the "Ainu" people, leaving behind a distinctive culture. 
            Here, you can experience landscapes and history distinct from traditional Japan.</p>

        <p>Japan Sapporo Mission is where I served. Hokkaido's food and scenery were absolutely amazing. 
            While sushi is famous throughout Japan, if you want the best sushi, you should go to Hokkaido.</p>
