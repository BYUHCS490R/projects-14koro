        <h1>Okinawa</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to Japan's Hawaii!</h2>
        <p>Okinawa is an island located at the southernmost tip of Japan. Its climate is warm year-round, the sea is beautiful, and you can enjoy stunning scenery, making it very similar to Hawaii. 
            Even if you've been to Hawaii, you should go! Because Okinawa has a slightly different history from Japan and possesses many unique characteristics. 
            The buildings are distinctive, and the food is also incredibly delicious.</p>
